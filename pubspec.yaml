name: call_log
description: A Flutter plugin to access and query call history log. Currently enabled query params are dateFrom, dateTo, durationFrom, durationTo, name and number. String params are queried using LIKE and '%' wildcard on both sides. Support for Android only as iOS does not provide API for accessing call history.
